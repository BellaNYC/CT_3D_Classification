## Motivation and Related Work
A computerized tomography (CT) scan is the most widespread imaging examination worldwide
for diagnosis and screening many disorders, including adenomas, neoplasma and hemorrhages Hara
et al. Automated CT image interpretation could provide many benefits in medical settings,
such as workflow prioritization and clinical decision support, especially for time-sensitive cerebral
hemorrhages where immediate diagnosis is crucial. Recently, rapid CTC
detection of colorectal neoplasia is being assessed as a population screening tool. Here, our aim is
to develop a deep learning algorithm that detects colorectal neoplasia using CT images.
